  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    # Localization json files
    - locale/en.json
    - locale/ar.json
    - assets/home_screen/
    - assets/onboarding/
    # Images Folder
    - assets/images/
    # Images Folder
    - assets/images/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GroupsFontIcon
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/groups_font_icons/groups_font_icon.ttf
    - family:  Activty_icon
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/groups_font_icons/Activty_icon.ttf   
    - family: HomeScreenIconsFamily
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font_icons/home_screen_icons.ttf

    - family: AddParticipantIconFamily
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font_icons/add_participant.ttf
    - family: CloseIconFamily
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font_icons/close_icon.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
